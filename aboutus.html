            <h2>Our Mission Statement</h2>
            <p>To make charity convenient for those giving it & make it dignified for the ones receiving.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="started">
            <h2>How We Started</h2>
            <p>Our team is currently based out of New York City, and most of us attended public school. In public school, students would be served meals that were not very good and the only food that was acceptable for almost all students was the PB&J or cheese sandwich (for those allergic). We figured, it must not be too expensive to make the sandwiches and according to our research, almost 50% of Americans have peanut butter in their home. The first idea that came to us was that we could feed homeless or hungry this because it was respectable and if we could enable others to take 5-minnutes out of their day, then it would make the world a much better place.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="goals">
            <h2>Our Goals</h2>
            <p>We want to revolutionize philantropy, the same way that Uber democratized transportation, or Airbnb doing the same with travel. We hope to improve New York City to the point where people in need are sustained consistently, and after that we will expand other major cities across the United States. </p>
